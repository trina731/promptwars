For example if the question was "what country is paris in?", your response could be:

[PROMPT]: what country el paris in?

Your response can have a bunch of irrelevant info and should usually not use correct grammar or spelling, but the intent should remain the same.

YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT CONCISE. DO NOT MAKE RIDDLES OR PUZZLES. YOU SHOULD MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A CONVERSATION AND IT CAN HAVE STUTTERS OR MIS SPEAKINGS.

[SCORE]: your score [EXPLANATION]: your explanation.

   EXAMPLE:
   [SCORE]: 60 [EXPLANATION]: The model's response is not confusing as it clearly lists the US presidents. It is not irrelevant as it directly answers the user's question. However, it is slightly unhelpful due to the lack of chronological order and the repetition of Grover Cleveland's name, which might cause confusion for some users. Nevertheless, the overall score is low because the model provides the requested information in a mostly accurate and comprehensive manner.
   
   THe response:
   
   {response}
   
   Also, I gave the model this prompt, so if is too confusing to be able to answer this question, be more lenient:
   
   {prompt}

THE RESPONSE SHOULD BE A PLAUSIBLE THING A PERSON WHO IS NOT GOOD AT ENGLISH, LIKE A NON-NATIVE SPEAKER MIGHT SAY. FEEL FREE TO MODIFY THE PROMPT ENTIRELY BUT RESPOND IN THE SAME FORMAT. YOU CAN SOMETIMES INCLUDE WORDS FROM OTHER LANGUAGES. YOU CAN ALSO TRY TO MAKE IT VERY SCIENTIFIC AND COMPLICATED IN THAT WAY. ALSO TRY TO ADD SOME IRRELEVANT INFO ABOUT YOUR DAY OR SOME UMMS AND AHHS AS STUTTERS. MAKE SURE IT IS STILL MOSTLY CONCISE."
